            <h3>An interactive experience on the shape and reasons of social inequality</h3>
            <hr>

            <p>
                Social inequality is a source of a great deal of political arguments, and has been for quite a while. For some, the very existence of differences in lifestyle
                as big as the ones between a minimum wage worker in a restaurant and the CEO of a big corporation is a fundamental injustice. Other argue however that this difference
                only reflects a much more natural one: a difference in talent, or hard work, between the two.
            </p>
            <p>
                In February 2018, a paper was published studying this very problem with a simple mathematical model. Specifically, the paper focuses on the source of success, 
                and whether it is true that the best get farther, or if it's not rather just a matter of chance. The paper is title "Talent vs. Luck: the role of randomness in
                success and failure", by A. Pluchino, A.E. Biondo, and A. Rapisarda, and can be downloaded <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068" target="_blank">here</a>.
                If you know a bit of mathematics, it's a pretty easy read.

            <p>
                It says that, if we make some reasonable assumptions, the amount of individual talent and hard work (our so-called <strong>pluck</strong> - yes, it's <a href="http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Bruford">a Jojo reference</a>) is not enough to
                explain the shape of the
                distribution of wealth in our world. Rather, the distribution that we observe can only be justified by a fair amount of <strong>luck</strong>. In other words, 
                rich people aren't most likely all rich because they're that good at whatever it is that they do. A lot of them are probably pretty average; they ended up being
                rich because good things just happened to them by chance.
            </p>
            <div class="spacer-2"></div>
            <h2>Wait, shape of the distribution? What is that?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                It's the mathematical way that we use to describe how likely it is to find a member of a certain group having a certain quality. A curve that 
                connects the value of that quality (for example, a certain personal worth) to the likelihood of finding someone who has that value (for example, the likelihood 
                of picking a random person and finding them having a personal worth higher than $1M is obviously tiny).

                <div id="chart-gaussian" class="ct-chart ct-perfect-fourth"></div>
            </div>
            <script>
                makeGaussianPlot('#chart-gaussian');
            </script>

            <p>
                For example, this is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a>. It represents things where a lot of people have so-and-so values (the peak in the middle), 
                but very few people have either very low or very high ones (the tails at the left and right extremes). This is a typical distribution for IQ:
                a lot of normal people, a few geniuses and a few complete idiots.

                <div id="chart-pareto" class="ct-chart ct-perfect-fourth"></div>
            </div>
            <script>
                makeParetoPlot('#chart-pareto');
            </script>

            This, instead, is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto distribution</a>.
